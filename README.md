# mlee138_2048_proj2

This was an attempt at recreating the well known mobile game 2048. Unfortunately, the app was not completed on time and has very little functionality. It is able to read swipes, but doesn't have the overall logic of the game, so each swipe will only increase the points. New Game will reset underlying values, but will appear to do nothing.
